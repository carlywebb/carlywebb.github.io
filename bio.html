          <h3>Let's get to know each other</h3>
          <p><b>There have always been a couple constants in my life:</b> my desire to help others and my need to create. Incorporating these loves into my daily life has been easy at times, but I wasn’t always able to find a way to successfully incorporate them into a fulfilling career. That is, until I took a risk that changed everything. My journey to become a UX Designer has been a long time coming, and while it wasn’t the most direct path, it was the path that led me to my dream career. A career that is consistent with my values. A career that lets me create constantly and provide solutions that help others. As a UX Designer I follow my heart and apply my altruistic and unique touch to everything I create. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>After years working in a sales role for LivingSocial and then TripAdvisor,</b> I found myself growing increasingly restless with no creative outlet. It was time for me to take a leap of faith. I wanted to learn something new that would align with all my needs and values, not just one. By this time, I was living in San Francisco and watching my company go through a re-design and re-brand. I was participating in some user testing when it clicked. I didn’t want to just give feedback, I wanted to be a part of all of it. I wanted to be the one researching and designing.</p>
          </br>
    <p><b>I signed up for a UX design bootcamp shortly thereafter. </b>I knew it was a risk. A few cautioned against the struggle of juggling work and classes, but I chose to listen to my gut and trust in myself that it would be worth it in the end—and it was. I had access to wonderful and challenging coursework and the opportunity to work one on one with some of the smartest, most helpful human beings on the planet. My personal mentor was an accomplished industry professional with an impressive track record, who was always there for me as I learned everything about UX Design. I truly feel like I was able to learn from the best.</p>
  </br>
    <p><b>I am grateful for my journey;</b> it has given me a well-rounded business acumen that enhances my work to make me a stronger designer. This is why my approach to design always centers around user testing and lots of research. Without people and their feedback, my designs can’t do what they are meant to do.</p>
  </br>
    <p><b>I am proud to have a career </b> where I use my natural strengths, talents and interests day in and day out to help people and to make this crazy, complicated world just a little bit more simple. Please take a look at my work and please get in touch if you have questions or even just want to chat about UX! I am often available for freelance work and would be thrilled to be a part of your next project.</p>
