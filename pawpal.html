                  <p>There are many resources for pet owners, but the market is still lacking in terms of technology. For example, you can easily book a doctors appointment for yourself online or speak with a therapist instantly via a mobile app, but technological advances providing this experience in regard to your pets are few and far between. The only way at this time to get behavioral help for your pet is to hire a trainer which is often time consuming and expensive or consult veterinarians who are neither licensed nor specialized in behavioral training practices.</p>

             <div>
              <p>I created a research survey specifically targeted to pet owners that evaluated how they viewed their pet’s behavioral health and obedience and their approaches to solving problems they encountered with their pets. I also gauged what their satisfaction was with the resources already available on the market to see if there was a need for a new product. I focused on the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How important owners viewed their pet’s behavioral health and obedience</li>
                  <li>How owners viewed the affordability of the current resources available on the market</li>
                  <li>How satisfied and familiar owners were with pet services products currently on the market</li>
                  <li>How owners approached a problem scenario that would require pet behavioral advice</li>
                </ul>

                      <p>I wasn’t surprised to learn that most owners view their pet’s overall health and wellbeing as extremely important to them with all owners selecting an 8 or higher in terms of importance on a scale from 1-10. I was pleased to learn that owners were extremely frustrated with the lack of affordable and convenient resources available to them, most owners reported searching online when they encountered a problem with their pet. Owners also reported that they would be more willing to consult a professional if services were more readily available and affordable.</p>

I chose to focus on Wag and Rover which provide pet sitting and advice services as well as Yelp which compiles reviews and provides exposure for pet trainers.</h6>

                 <h3>Colors, Typeface &amp; Style</h3>
                  <p>Because PawPal is a professional service, I didn’t want to go too playful with my styling which is why I chose a serif font for my headings and CTAs and an easy-to-read familiar sans-serif font for my text. I wanted to keep the attitude of the site friendly and approachable with bright colors and soft rounded corners on my boxes. I also wanted to ensure a cohesive color pallette which is why I chose all cool colors in my pallette. I wanted to inspire a calm and relaxing vibe while maintaining a high level of professionalism and trust. </p>

                  <p>My first sketches of the PawPal logo later turned into what the logo is now. I created my initial wireframes in sketch so I could have a higher level of specificity. These wireframes were my guiding force behind later creating my HiFi mockups. Creating my wireframes first allowed me to do some preliminary user testing and get some feedback before moving forward.</p>

I started with the desktop site, since I wanted to ensure I had that all buttoned up before I began creating the mobile app.  </p>

              <h3>Revisions and The Final Product</h3>
              <p>After performing user tests live, online and also gathering feedback through preference tests, I was able to collect all of this feedback into more iterations of the product until the user experience was seamless, intuitive and simple. I wanted to ensure that I tested with all different types of users (not only pet owners) so that I could ensure that all of the content was easy to understand and digest and the site had a clear and easy flow to it. You can see some of my iterations below and how they evolved to become the final product. </p>

            <h3 id="reflection">What I Learned</h3>
              <p>This was the first project that I was able to take a problem and solve it with an original idea for an application. It was exciting during the research phase to find out that there was not an application like this that had already been created and my research proved to me that there was a need and want for a product like this. I got to be extremely creative throughout the entire process, from the very beginnings of figuring out exactly how I wanted to app to function down to the fine details of color gradients and typeface. One of the most important things I learned during this process was the importance of certain UI elements that users are thrilled to find are similar among varied websites and applications. Some examples are the filter and sort bar on the expert search page. Users were immediately drawn to how familiar and easy to use it was. Same goes for the pet profile set-up process and filling out forms. </p>
                <p>I learned the importance of uniformity among forms and the statistics of how much more likely a user is to complete filling out a form if it is familiar to them and easy to navigate. I will always remember this project as being one that I am most proud of, where I got to unleash so many of my own original ideas and creativity.</p>
