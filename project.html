     <h3 id="discovery">User Research</h3>
     <div>
      <p>I created a user research survey to diagnose the major pain points and understand better how users interacted with the current cloud platforms on the market. Focuses were:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
          <li>How people browsed the internet and saved interesting content</li>
          <li>How people liked to separate their personal and professional content</li>
          <li>What tools people used to save online content, save their own personal documents and what they liked or disliked about those tools</li>
          <li>How people shared resources with colleages at work and personal friends respectively</li>

          <div>
            <p>I summarized the data and identified common user motivations, frustrations, and considerations, including:</p>
            <h4>Top used cloud apps:</h4>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Google Drive</li>
              <li>iCloud</li>
              <li>Dropbox</li>
              <li>Pinterest</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              <h4>Most important features:</h4>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Ability to share content and information easily with others</li>
              <li>Uploading files (Images, pdf, video) from mobile device</li>
              <li>Sharing a single item with someone else and vice versa</li>
              <li>Downloading items for offline usage</li>
              <li>Share a folder with someone else and vice versa</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              <h4>Least important features:</h4>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Saving content you find on the web</li>
              <li>Creating original content</li>
              <li>Ability to connect with other for real-time collaboration on notes and documents</li>
              <li>Ability to download for offline usage</li>
            </ol>
              <div class="what-discovered">
              <h3>What I Discovered</h3>
              <p>The data that I gathered gave me incredible insight, namely that there are a few features that users find most important in their cloud storage app and there are gaps in the cloud market for these features.  Users wanted the ability to share content and information easily with others, the ability to upload files (Images, pdf, video) from their mobile device, share a single item or a folder with someone else and vice versa and download items for offline usage. From the data that I gathered in my survey I could already see the beginning of a new organization-based cloud storage platform that would meet users’ needs personally and professionally.</p>

          <p>I created three user personas based on my research. These personas included all of the different data that I had gathered regarding who my audience would be, what their frustrations were and what they wanted to accomplish.</p>

<!--Competitive Analysis-->
    <div class="container-fluid">
       <div class="competitive-analysis">
      <img src="images/competitive-icon.png" alt="Competitive Icon">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>Given the number of existing products on the market, I developed a SWOT analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox and Pinterest to determine where to focus my efforts.</p>
            <img class="google" src="images/google-drive.png" alt="Google Drive">
                <p>I knew I definitely wanted to analyze Google Drive since it was very favorably ranked in my user survey, and it was most favored when it came to ease of use. Google Drive is a very intuitive platform but fails in a few areas. It appeals primarily to Google users, as you need to have a Google account in order to use it. It also fails to appeal and integrate with Apple devices and with Apple users, and it doesn’t run on Linux whereas Dropbox does.</p>
            <img class="dropbox" src="images/dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox">
                <p>Dropbox has a lot of appeal in it’s brand and it’s business brand (Dropbox for Business) and is known for being fast and secure. Opportunities lie in it being purely a file storage service and nothing more, it’s very straight forward. It also is expensive and the market is saturated with competitors, and Dropbox does little to set itself apart. </p>
            <img class="pinterest" src="images/pinterest.png" alt="Pinterest">
                <p>Pinterest was an interesting analysis because it doesn’t quite fit the mold of a cloud platform, but it also doesn’t not fit the mold. There are aspects to Pinterest that are very appealing to users, specifically the design and intuitiveness of use. On the other hand there are limitations in capability and they have a limited audience since it appeals mainly to women. I used Pinterest as a model for the dashboard for Den, since users seem to like the ease of visual organization in the platform.</p>

<!--User Stories-->
      <div class="container-fluid">
         <div class="user-stories">
        <img src="images/user-stories-icon.png" alt="User Stories Icon">
          <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>My next step was creating user stories, where I used the data I had gathered thus far to determine the general direction for my platform. What did users need to accomplish? What were nice-to-haves? What did users want in this platform that frustrated them in other platforms? And lastly, what did a user absolutely need in order for the platform to be functional? I created over 50 user stories that would eventually inspire my user flows. Ranking the stories as low medium and high, I took all of my high priority stories and used those for my MVP.</p>
          <h3>Sample User Stories</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
              <li>High: I want to be able to log into my account.</li>
              <li>Medium: I want to search for certain files that I have saved in the app.</li>
              <li>Low: I want to have a good sense of my network and explore the community.</li>
            </ul>

         <h3>Colors, Typeface &amp; Style</h3>
          <p>I knew I wanted Den to have a homey, down to earth and rooted vibe, so I wanted to go with colors that would be associated with nature and with home. My goal was to find a color palette that would make the smell of pine trees or the sound of the wind blowing through leaves jump off the page. With Den being a place to keep personal treasures and important documents, it was important that I made it cozy yet bold, playful and fun, sparking a feeling of belonging. This inspired the style and direction of the project.</p>

         <h3>Sketches, Balsamiq Wireframes &amp; User Testing</h3>
          <p>In order to be able to share my initial design ideas with the client, I created wireframes in Balsamiq. This allowed me to put all of my user flows, sitemap and content to work to create something that would eventually become my full-fledged product. My wireframes allowed me to do my first user testing in InVision so that I could fine tune the layout of my pages before creating high fidelity mockups.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>My testing results showed that the initial ideas were good, but there needed to be more depth to the content and the sizing and details and placement of CTAs needed to be more deliberate. I took these results into my next phase, which was to create my high fidelity mockups.</p>

    <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
      <p>I gathered all of my research and ideas and went to work creating Den’s first high-fidelity prototype in Sketch. This was the part when I really got to take all of the personality and capabilities that I wanted Den to have and bring it all to life. I created enough for Den’s MVP, which would include a landing page, a sign up page, a log in page, the dashboard, account settings and storage plan page. Also, in order to give the client an idea what the Den app would look like on mobile, I created a landing page, dashboard and navigation screen on mobile. Once this was complete, I went back to the client to get approval to move forward with more user testing. </p>

      <h3>More Testing and Finishing Touches</h3>
      <p>I loaded all of my mockups into InVision so that I could perform another series of tests with potential users to ensure that each revision to the design was done to improve usability. I also received feedback from key stakeholders regarding the layout to improve the flow and ensure all content was easily readable as well as accessible to all types of potential users. Final revisions were made once all of the concerns my users brought up were addressed, and the final product on Den was born. </p>

    <h3 id="reflection">What I Learned</h3>
      <p>Throughtout this project I learned so much about the design process and most importantly gained so much insight into user needs. Creating Den challenged me to take a very well known platform, cloud storage, and turn it into something different, better and more useful to my audience. I learned the importance of frequent user testing in all stages of the design process. From the very beginning when I started with my user survey, I knew there was a huge opportunity in this space and even though the direction from the client was somewhat vague, my users led me in the direction that I needed to go throughout the entire process. </p>
